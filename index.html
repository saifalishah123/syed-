            <h1 class="shah">PAKISTAN TOURS PACAKAGES</h1>
            <p class="pakistan">Pakistan tourism is about to be turned around into a world class tourism destination and
                slump in sale of tours packages is over, so Pakistan as tourist destination is now on boom. We are proud
                to say welcome again to the guests to Pakistan that is part of the traditional hospitality the people of
                Pakistan are famous for. We invite you to a land that is must to see for nature, culture and mountain
                lovers. The Karakoram Highway passing through Hunza Valley is simply breathtaking. There is no match of
                the beauty of the north of Pakistan with the Alps of Europe or elsewhere in the world. It is not
                possible to describe in the words but would loudly support the claim after you have done Pakistan tour.

                    <h2>Sawat</h2>
                    <p>The special weapons and tactics concept originated in the late 1960s as a result of several
                        sniping incidents against civilians and police officers around the country. Many of these
                        incidents occurred in Los Angeles during and after the Watts Riot.

                    <h2>Sakardu Tour</h2>
                    <p>The Skardu region was part of the cultural sphere of Buddhist Tibet since the founding of the
                        Tibetan Empire under Songsten Gampo in the mid 7th-century CE. Tibetan tantric scriptures were
                        found all over Baltistan until about the 9th century.</p>

                    <h2>Neelum Tour</h2>
                    <p>Moreover like Kaghan Valley it is famous for fishing and angling activities in Neelum River and
                        Jagran Nullah which are stocked with trout fish. A fair weather road opens the valley to
                        tourists up to Kel, 165 kilometers from Muzaffarabad.

                    <h2>Naran Tour</h2>
                    <p>It can be said that the Naran Kaghan Valley is the most attractive tourist destination, so that's
                        why it's getting better every day. On the other hand, Swat is still not as famous as Naran,
                        which is why it is overlooked. Swat has only a few tourist attractions, as Naran has more.

                    <h2>Murree Tour</h2>
                    <p>The name "Murree" means "high place" and it stands at 7,517 feet above sea level in the Pir
                        Panjal range. It was founded in the 18th century by the British, and served as the summer
                        headquarters of the British Raj in the Punjab Province until 1864.

                    <h2>Hunza Tour</h2>
                    <p>The Hunza valley is popular for its snow-capped and rough mountains. Many people came to Hunza
                        just to get a few glimpses of the shining ice wall of the Rakaposhi Mountain. Other popular
                        mountains in Hunza include Passu Peak, Ultra Peak, and Kuksel Sar.</p>

                        (the Pakistani government declared the location a National Park in 1995). The site serves as a
                        launching point for mountain climbers summiting the northern face of the Nanga Parbat.</p>
